	Chernobyl Commemoration 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary
</amp-fit-text>

<p class="flow-text text-justify"><b>
	To coincide with the 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of The Chernobyl Disaster, The Greater Chernobyl Cause will send a shipment filled with Humanitarian Aid. It will  leave the Port of Cork bound for the our newly built hospice in Semipalatinsk Kazakhstan.
</b></p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify"><b>
	The aid includes vital hospital equipment, new clothes, therapy aids, household goods, etc. which will also go to the neglected hospitals, homeless shelters, care centres and impoverished villages in Kazakhstan.
</b></p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	As we commemorate the 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Chernobyl Disaster, it is important to note that the people of Kazakhstan were also involved in the dreaded clean up at The Chernobyl Plant. In fact Leonid Petrovich Telyatnikov, who was born  in  1951, in, Kostanai, Kazakhstan, was the head of the fire department at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and led the team of firefighters to the fire at Reactor Number 4 which became the Chernobyl disaster.
</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	Despite the radiological dangers, they had no radiation suits, no respirators, and no working dosimeters. From the results of a blood test, it was estimated he received 4 grays of radiation.
</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	Telyatnikov headed the firefighting effort at Chernobyl Reactor Unit 4 after the explosion on April 26, 1986. At that time Telyatnikov was the chief of military fire prevention at the Chernobyl nuclear-power station. Telyatnikov and his colleagues, a number of those also from Kazakhstan (as these countries were all part of the USSR), ascended the badly damaged and heavily radiation-contaminated roof of Reactor Unit 4 more than once in order to prevent the fires from spreading and endangering Reactor Unit 3. In 1987 Telyatnikov was named a Hero of the Soviet Union. Two of his assistants, Vladimir Pravik and Viktor Kibenok, were given the award posthumously, as they died from acute radiation sickness soon after the disaster.
</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	Telyatnikov continued his service in the Ministry of the Interior of the USSR and, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, in Ukraine.
</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	In 1998, Telyatnikov headed the volunteer fire department of Kiev, and designed the "Junior Firefighter" program.  He died of cancer at the age of 53. On April 26, 2006, the twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, a monument was dedicated to him at the Baykove cemetery in Kiev where he is buried.
</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	This 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary marks the starting point – not the limit – of the Chernobyl catastrophe which continues to unfold even today. Chernobyl is not in the past. Its repercussions are still being felt by some five million people living in areas of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia who were contaminated as a result of the accident. They have to cope with the ongoing political, social, environmental and health consequences of the disaster.
</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	We must ensure that no more Chernobyl's ever take place again. The only way we can do this is to ensure that nuclear power has no future, whilst investing in renewable alternatives. Those who speak about the benefits of nuclear power should look deeply into the eyes and souls of the innocent victims, generations of alienated and forgotten people.  Whatever the obstacles we encounter along the way, we are certain of one thing... the plight of its abandoned people cannot be forgotten.
