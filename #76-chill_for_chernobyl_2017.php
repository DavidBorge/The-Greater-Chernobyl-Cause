	All funds raised from Chill for Chernobyl 2017 will fund our ongoing urgent projects. Our charity is now experiencing a funding crisis, which is threatening the lives of elderly and dying patients where they have been bringing hope where there was once only despair. In hospices, halfway houses we are continually shocked by conditions where the lack of food, medicines and basic hygiene leave the old and vulnerable in a desperate state. The tough economic times have left people with less disposable income but the charity’s survival is crucial because of the nature of the work they do. We are desperate for help, as we need to continue to be a glimmer of light in the darkness of so many vulnerable lives.  In the past The Greater Chernobyl Cause have shown strength in the face of adversity but we are now facing a most daunting challenge as donations run out because of the credit crunch. It is essential that we make a difference and bring help, hope and healing in a hurting world.
