	The subsequent collapse of The Soviet Union saw Fiona Corcoran widened her efforts in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. These countries gained their independence but at an enormous cost in terms of financial and social support. The casualties of this poverty are abandoned children and desperate adults. While much of the world ignores their plight, the Greater Chernobyl Cause has risen to the challenge to provide help and hope for the future.

	Kazakhstan, the size of Western Europe, presents the charity with its greatest challenge. As the only Irish charity operating in that region, the Greater Chernobyl Cause strives to bring hope and give life to the children of Kazakhstan.
