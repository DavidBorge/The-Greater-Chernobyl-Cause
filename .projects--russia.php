	Russia is the world’s largest country and is struggling to meet the demands of an ageing population. Meagre pensions and a lack of decent medical facilities have brought hardship at every turn.

	<p class="flow-text text-justify">In 2010, Fiona Corcoran visited the hospice in Ivanskoye, 200 miles northeast of Moscow. Here elderly inmates existed in shocking conditions without even basic hygiene or facilities. The hospice was in such a dreadful state that the Government shut it down, condemning the patients to the prospect of a slow and painful death. The only ambulance was withdrawn and with no other way to bring them to hospital, there were several cases of old people being found dead in their beds weeks after they had succumbed to the freezing conditions and left with nothing to eat. Doctors in the area have been forced to walk up to 20 km. a day to visit their patients. Fiona hoped to open the hospice as a secure and liveable residence for up to twenty-five people. This renovation project aimed to replace antique toilets and plumbing, provide new showers, proper dormitories, a kitchen and laundry.</p>
	<p class="flow-text text-justify">The project so far has been successful and has cost 100, 000 euro. The charity recently purchased an ambulance and has made major improvements to renovation, diet, medical care and hygiene. This includes cosmetic repair to shower rooms and toilets to enable better hygiene for clients. The stove and catering service was revamped ensuring better provision for and access to correct nutrition. Water heaters were repaired as a necessary part of kitchen equipment facilities as well as the purchase of a new fridge freezer. Twenty-five beds as well as orthopaedic mattresses and cabinets were purchased for correct and comfortable client care. Additionally for health and safety reasons a fire escape was installed.The hospice has since been opened and The Greater Chernobyl Cause plans to have this facility fully renovated, so it will then be a safe and secure hospice for up to twenty-five residents.</p>
	<p class="last-paragraph flow-text text-justify">What now remains is the laundry department and we have a <b>shortfall of €11,000</b> to complete this vital project.</p>
