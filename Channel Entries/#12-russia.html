	Russia is the world&rsquo;s largest country and is struggling to meet the demands of an ageing population. Meagre pensions and a lack of decent medical facilities have brought hardship at every turn.</p>

			The Director of the Greater Chernobyl Cause, Fiona Corcoran, recently visited the village of Ivanskoye, 200 miles north east of Moscow. Here, in the depths of winter and with the temperature a cruel 20 degrees below freezing, she visited the community&rsquo;s dilapidated hospice and listened to disturbing stories from some of Russia&rsquo;s poorest people. Maybe you&rsquo;d like to watch and listen too.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			This project is an urgent one. The local authority has now condemned the hospice as uninhabitable and closed it down. Patients have been uprooted and moved miles to a general hospital which is unable to cope with their particular needs.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			The Greater Chernobyl Cause also has plans to save the village&rsquo;s day clinic which provides a lifeline to a beleagured rural community but needs major refurbishment.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			Ivanskoye Hospice and Clinic needs at least 60,000 Euros to fund a complete renovation and desperately needs YOUR contribution. To find out exactly how to donate, visit the How you can help page here.</p>
