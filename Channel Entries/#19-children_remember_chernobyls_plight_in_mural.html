	THEY say a picture is worth a thousand words &mdash; and the artistic young people of Mahon will be the talk of the Cork suburb after completing a mural commemorating the Chernobyl disaster.</p>


<p>
	The mural was unveiled yesterday.<br />
	Almost 25 years after the disaster occurred, the group of local children have highlighted the importance of remembering the ongoing plight of Chernobyl victims by painting their own interpretation of history&rsquo;s worst nuclear accident.<br />
	Stretching across the walls of the Mahon Community Centre, the mural was created by 13 children between the ages of 10 and 16 as part of the Mahon Action for Youth Project.<br />
	Chief executive of the Greater Chernobyl Cause charity, Fiona Corcoran said it was a credit to the community that awareness of the important global issue was being kept alive and strong.<br />
	&quot;There is still widespread contamination in Chernobyl and many people there are suffering from cancers and other serious health issues. This incredible mural will ensure that people won&rsquo;t forget about the world&rsquo;s worst nuclear disaster for the foreseeable future.&quot;<br />
	Labour&rsquo;s Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch said the mural was a reflection of the Cork-based charities continued work for the people of the Ukraine and Kazakhstan.<br />
	&quot;Even though we are nearly 3,000 miles from Chernobyl, the mural will ensure that the issue is kept to the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds.&quot;<br />
	One of the artists who aided in planning the mural, Spark Deeley, said that through painting their understanding of Chernobyl the children got a better grasp of the event itself.<br />
	&quot;None of the kids who worked on the mural were even born when the disaster happened, but through painting they were able to express how they felt about the things they learned about Chernobyl.&quot;<br />
	Mahon community is home to Ireland&rsquo;s largest mural.<br />
	Manager of Mahon Community Centre, Denis Coffey, said involving young people in mural projects had a very positive effect on the area.<br />
	&quot;We had a problem with graffiti so we decided to get the kids involved in painting murals and it has really promoted respect for the area.<br />
	&quot;The Chernobyl mural is the fifth to be painted in the area and we hope that we can continue raising awareness of important issues in this way.&quot;<br />
	The Greater Chernobyl Cause is the only Irish charity working in Kazakhstan.<br />
