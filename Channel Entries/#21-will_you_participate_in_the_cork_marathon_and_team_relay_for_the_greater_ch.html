<p>
	One of the exciting aspects of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy Cork City Marathon is the Team Relay, which really makes this The Marathon for Everyone!<br />
	<br />
	The relay offers runners, joggers and walkers of all distances an opportunity to take part in the marathon without having to complete the full 26.2 miles.<br />
	<br />
	If you&#39;re over 18 on the day you&#39;re included and, remember, there&#39;s no upper age limit!</p>
<p>
	The team can be made up of between 2 and 5 runners.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Teams can be mixed or all male/all female</li>
	<li>
		Each Team appoints one member as a Captain, who will be the point of contact for the race organisers.</li>
	<li>
		Only one entry form per team is required - the Team Captain must fill this out. The form is the same as for the individual marathon, but additional details must be filled in for the Relay. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		As with the individual marathon, all team members must be 18 years of age or older on 5th June 2011.</li>
</ul>
