	My dear friends<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	Please meet &ldquo;Rolo The Clown&rdquo;! Well, Rolo used to have the biggest smile the world could offer but this year the bricks of his happiness began to fall one by one until his smile faded away.<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	But thanks to the love and care of his many friends and family, they helped pick up Rolo and shouldered him back to a world of smiles and laughter.<br />
	<br />
	So now he wants to give something back to all the people who suffer in silence from losing their smile and thinking that there is no end to the road&hellip; Yes, there is!<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	So next Monday Rolo is going to run the Dublin City Marathon for all his friends at The Greater Chernobyl Cause&nbsp;</p>
