	<b>Charity Founder in desperate appeal for help</b></p>
<p class="p3">
	A funding crisis is threatening the lives of elderly and dying patients in Central Asia where an Irish charity has been bringing&nbsp;hope where there was once only despair.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
	The Greater Chernobyl Cause, based in Cork, was shocked by conditions at a hospice in the industrial Kazak city of&nbsp;Semipalatinsk where the lack of food, medicines and basic hygiene had left the old and vulnerable in a desperate state. &nbsp;Skeletal&nbsp;were abandoned without hope or comfort and sprawled across jagged and broken bed springs.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
	Over the past four years, the charity&rsquo;s founder, Fiona Corcoran, has been struggling to make improvements, replacing squalor&nbsp;with warmth and dignity. But the building is dilapidated and desperately needs replacing.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
	With the available funds, Fiona has overseen the start of an entirely new hospice within the grounds of the city&rsquo;s General&nbsp;Hospital. The foundations are laid, the basic structure is in place but work will stop unless further funding can be provided for the completion of this life-saving project.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
	&ldquo;These are tough economic times when people have less disposable income,&rdquo; says Fiona, &ldquo;but our charity&rsquo;s survival is crucial&nbsp;because of the nature of the work we do. We are desperate for your help as we need to continue to be a glimmer of light in the&nbsp;darkness of so many vulnerable lives.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
	&ldquo;The cost of completing this much needed hospice is &euro;170,000 which is just a fraction of what it would cost to erect a similar&nbsp;in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p3">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
	Over the years, Fiona, an inspirational and self-driven figure, has shown her strength in the face of adversity but this time she&nbsp;facing her most daunting challenge as donations run out because of the credit crunch.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
	Her appeal is straightforward. &ldquo; Together, we can make a difference and bring help, hope and healing in a hurting world. &nbsp;Please give whatever you can to save this project. We need to be there for those who need us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
