	On hearing of the charity&rsquo;s pleas for support, Ukraine International Airlines immediately offered to fly Fiona Corcoran, Founder of the Greater Chernobyl Cause, to the Kazak city of Almaty which has emerged as one of its busiest routes.<br />
	<br />
	There, there are plans to hold high level talks with Government, business and embassy staff in efforts to raise the necessary funds to complete a two storey hospice in the North-Eastern city of Semipalatinsk where desperate patients can find warmth and dignity alongside badly needed palliative care.<br />
	<br />
	The Greater Chernobyl cause already raised 150,000 Euros but work has come to a halt at a vital stage with another 100,000 Euros required to complete the building on land the authorities have provided within the grounds of the city&rsquo;s General Hospital.<br />
	<br />
	Plans are now at a critical stage with patients still confined to the old building where untiring and dedicated efforts have been made to bring some degree of human dignity for patients who lived in abject squalor. In tiny fly-blown rooms, the chronically sick were lying side by side who those with mental disabilities and others thought to be suffering from long term exposure to radiation from the former Soviet nuclear testing site nearby.<br />
	<br />
	Better hygiene means that the stench of urine has been removed and the pitiful daily food allowance increased, allowing fresh meat and vegetables to be introduced to a menu that once produced little more than watery porridge gruel.<br />
	<br />
	Yet so much more remains to be done and can only be achieved with the completion of the new hospice. Fiona Corcoran believes that even in these difficult economic times, the people of Ireland will want to respond.<br />
	<br />
	In 2010, the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan awarded Fiona Corcoran its highest civilian honour for her outstanding humanitarian work in the largest landlocked country in the world. Fiona Corcoran received the Honorary Diploma and medal from President Nursultan Nazarbayev at Ak Orda Palace in the Kazak capital of Astana.<br />
	<br />
	Last year Fiona received The Order of Princess Olga from President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. The Order is a very rare Ukrainian civil decoration featuring the 10th Century Kiev Saint and is bestowed only to women for outstanding personal achievements in science, education or charity work. It is unknown for the award to be presented to a foreigner. She accepted these awards as recognition not just of herself and the work she carries out but also of all the volunteers who have so tirelessly and generously given of their time to this cause over the years that have transpired since the charity&rsquo;s inception.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;The roar of the Celtic Tiger may have been silenced. Yet however badly off we think we are, it simply does not compare with the depravity, devastation and sheer desperation of these wretched people whose only hope depends on the generosity of others.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;When you think the EuroMillions jackpot recently paid out over 100 Million Euros, if someone gave just a hundredth of that, it would be enough to transform the lives of thousands of the world&rsquo;s weakest and most vulnerable people.&rdquo;</span><br />
