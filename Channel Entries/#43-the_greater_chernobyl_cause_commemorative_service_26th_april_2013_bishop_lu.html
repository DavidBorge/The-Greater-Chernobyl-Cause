	Poetry reading, singing by a school choir, an ecumenical service and the laying of a wreath at the Chernobyl Birch Garden all form part of the event. Candles will also be lit as a roll call of some of the victims of the 1986 disaster is read out. A minute&rsquo;s silence will be observed before the playing of the Last Post and a flag is lowered to half mast. Cork&rsquo;s Lord Mayor, Councillor Terry Shannon and the Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland, HE Sergi Reva, and H.E. Mr. Maxim Peshkov Russian Ambassador to Ireland, will address the assembled crowds.</p>

	Fiona Corcoran, founder of The Greater Chernobyl Cause, insists:&nbsp; &ldquo;This anniversary marks the starting point &ndash; not the limit &ndash; of the Chernobyl catastrophe which continues to unfold even today. Chernobyl is not in the past. Its repercussions are still being felt by some five million people living in areas of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia who were contaminated as a result of the accident. They have to cope with the ongoing political, social, environmental and health consequences of the disaster.&rdquo;Many are still haunted by fears over the safety of nuclear energy, especially following the recent tsunami and earthquake in Japan.</p>
<p style="margin-left:22.5pt;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:22.5pt;">
	Estimates of deaths directly attributable to the disaster vary from four thousand to well over a hundred thousand and doctors have expressed their concern about an increase in cancers and blood diseases among a new generation of children living on the edge of the strictly imposed exclusion zones. At the site of the disaster, Reactor No4 now lies eerily silent &hellip; so too, the other three reactors, as work continues on decommissioning and on replacing a crumbling and leaking sarcophagus built to contain tons of radioactive dust and debris. The now deserted and ghostly city of Pripyat was built to house many of the plant&rsquo;s workers and their families. In all, 50,000 people were evacuated. Told they would be returning in a few days, they left all their possessions behind. In one school classroom pencils and jotters pupils had been using on the day before the explosion are scattered on the floors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22.5pt;">
	Government officials were totally irresponsible &nbsp;They allowed the children to go outside when rain was falling from the sky and knowing that the land was contaminated.&rsquo; Elderly villagers now defy the authorities are still growing vegetables just a few kilometres from the site despite the dangers of contamination. The Greater Chernobyl Cause&rsquo;s main emphasis is on providing help and life saving medical equipment for the long term victims of the disaster and the growing number of children who are being diagnosed with cancer, leukaemia and acute respiratory infections. Many of them come from contaminated areas on the edge of the exclusion zones.</p>
<p style="margin-left:22.5pt;">

<p style="margin-left:22.5pt;">
	The charity supports a rehabilitation centre and the Radiological Hospital in Kiev where hundreds of patients are clamouring to be seen every day. Their hopes rest on more modern equipment to deal with cancers and other illnesses. The Greater Chernobyl Cause&rsquo;s projects include building care centres, renovating hospitals, supporting clinics, the homeless etc The Greater Chernobyl Cause has helped thousands in the wake of the disaster and last year, Fiona was awarded Ukraine&rsquo;s highest humanitarian award, The Order of Princess Olga from&nbsp; The President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22.5pt;">
	&ldquo;Our work must continue. Without substantial outside help what hope can there be for a generation of alienated and abandoned children? I urge you to please make a donation so that more young lives can be saved.&rsquo; Concluded Fiona Corcoran.</p>
