	GREATER CHERNOBYL CAUSE CHRISTMAS CRAFT FAIR</p>
<p style="margin-left:9.0pt;">
	Sunday 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;December</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Greater Chernobyl Cause will host its annual Christmas Craft Fair at The Cork Opera House&nbsp;on Sunday&nbsp;the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;December. Doors will open at&nbsp;12 noon.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	An excellent array of items including pottery and gold and silver ware will be on sale at extremely reasonable prices. Crystal, Wood &amp; Iron Work, Xmas Cards, Toys, Candles, Knitwear and Creations by Top Irish Clothes Designers are just some of the unique items available. All items have been donated for sale by very generous artists.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Your Christmas presents can be purchased under the one roof at recessionary prices.</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	All monies raised from the Greater Chernobyl Cause&rsquo;s Christmas Fair, will go towards the ongoing construction of our hospice in Semipalatinsk, North Eastern Kazakhstan. The sick and elderly people who will live there desperately need a safe haven and are depending on the generosity and kindness that Irish people have consistently shown to our charity.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Tough economic times have left people with less disposable income but our charity&rsquo;s survival is crucial because of the nature of the work we do. We are desperate for help as we need to continue to be a glimmer of light in the darkness of so many vulnerable lives. It is essential that we make a difference and bring help, hope and healing in a hurting world.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Greater Chernobyl would like to thank the board of the Cork Opera house for providing such a magnificent venue for our craft fair for the past 10 years. We would also like to express our gratitude to the people of Cork for their consistent support. Through their assistance, we have raised almost 130 thousand euro in total from this one event which has funded our many successful projects in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Russia.</p>
