	The charity is now experiencing a funding crisis which is threatening the lives of elderly and dying patients where they have been bringing hope where there was once only despair. In hospices, halfway houses they are continually shocked by conditions where the lack of food, medicines and basic hygiene leave the old and vulnerable in a desperate state. The tough economic times have left people with less disposable income but the charity&rsquo;s survival is crucial because of the nature of the work they do. They are desperate for help as they need to continue to be a glimmer of light in the darkness of so many vulnerable lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the past The Greater Chernobyl Cause have shown strength in the face of adversity but now are facing a most daunting challenge as donations run out because of the credit crunch. It is essential that they make a difference and bring help, hope and healing in a hurting world.</p>
