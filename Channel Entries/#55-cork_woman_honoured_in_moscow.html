	Cork woman Fiona Corcoran, a charity worker with The Greater Chernobyl Cause, has become the only Irish person in history to have been awarded Russia&rsquo;s Order of Friendship.</p>
<p>
	The charity worker was presented with the honour by Russia&rsquo;s President Vladimir Putin at a ceremony in the Kremlin last week to thank her for what he called her &ldquo;outstanding humanitarian work in Russia&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	Ms Corcoran told Mr Putin she was accepting the award &ldquo;on behalf of the charity supporters who have helped us in our very long journey&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The award which you have bestowed on us today will bring our work forward for the very needy&rdquo; she informed President Putin, before finishing with a &ldquo;go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	For her part, Ms Corcoran presented President Putin with a pair of handmade bellows from Ireland because, as she said afterward, she had &ldquo;discovered that Putin liked spending time in the countryside so thought some bellows might make a good gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We discussed the works of The Greater Chernobyl Cause and Mr. Putin was well informed about our charitable activities and commended us on our achievements&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The whole event was surreal. His endorsement of our work is a huge boost and let&rsquo;s hope it stokes Russian interest in our projects.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
