	It&#39;s not easy to choose a present for a president, so when Fiona Corcoran was invited to Moscow to receive an award for her humanitarian work from Vladimir Putin, she thought long and hard before eventually deciding on a pair of hand-crafted Irish bellows.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;d heard Putin liked spending time in the countryside so thought some bellows might come in handy,&quot; says the founder of the Cork-based Greater Chernobyl Cause charity who became the first Irish citizen to receive the prestigious Russian Order of Friendship this month.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Putin&#39;s endorsement of our work is a huge boost,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s hope it stokes Russian interest in our projects.&quot;</p>

	After presiding over the awards ceremony in the glittering Saint George&#39;s Hall in the Kremlin, Putin took a seat beside Corcoran at a banquet.&nbsp;</p>
