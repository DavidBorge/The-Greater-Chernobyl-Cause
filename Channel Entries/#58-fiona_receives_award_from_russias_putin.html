	Fiona Corcoran: in Russia to receive her award from Putin</p>


<p>
	FOUNDER of the Greater Chernobyl Cause, Fiona Corcoran is in Moscow this week to receive the Order of Friendship for her outstanding humanitarian work in Russia from President Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Fiona, who hails from Fountainstown, is the first Irish person to be honoured in this way at the Kremlin. She has also been awarded with the Order of Princess Olga for her work in Ukraine and has been decorated with an honorary medal and diploma by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>
	With her team of voluntary supporters, she has worked tirelessly in efforts to transform the lives of some of the weakest and most vulnerable elderly people and children condemned to life in desperate and dilapidated institutions.</p>
<p>
	For the Greater Chernobyl Cause, it represents a triumph of sheer perseverance.However, the charity is now experiencing a funding crisis which is threatening the lives of elderly and dying patients where they have been bringing hope where there was once only despair. In hospices and halfway houses, they are continually shocked by conditions where the lack of food, medicines and basic hygiene leave the old and vulnerable in a desperate state. The tough economic times have left people with less disposable income but the charity&rsquo;s survival is crucial because of the nature of the work they do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	They are desperate for help as they need to continue to be a glimmer of light in the darkness of so many vulnerable lives.&nbsp;In the past, the Greater Chernobyl Cause has shown strength in the face of adversity, but is now facing a most daunting challenge as donations run out because of the credit crunch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The charity has one paid employee on an&nbsp;industrial wage, and rent, rates, storage, courier, flights, ferries and&nbsp;vehicle insurance are all sponsored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Greater Chernobyl Cause also works very closely&nbsp; (voluntarily) with the Irish Probation Service, rehabilitating female clients by giving them the opportunity and a chance&nbsp;to make a&nbsp;difference for their future.</p>
<p>
	Receiving her award at the Kremlin this week, Fiona said: &lsquo;I accept this on behalf of all our supporters through Ireland. &nbsp;This award will help our work tremendously in Russia&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Help is still urgently needed for all their projects, she added.</p>
