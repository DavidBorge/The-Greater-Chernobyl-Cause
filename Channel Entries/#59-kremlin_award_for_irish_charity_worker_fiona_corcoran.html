	Vladimir Putin&nbsp;has presented an award to Irish charity worker&nbsp;Fiona Corcoran&nbsp;in acknowledgement of the work of her Greater&nbsp;Chernobyl&nbsp;Cause in&nbsp;Russia.</p>
<p>
	The Russian president handed Ms Corcoran the Order of Friendship medal at a ceremony in the Kremlin today to thank her for her &ldquo;outstanding humanitarian work in Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Greater Chernobyl Cause was originally founded to help victims of the 1986 incident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in&nbsp;Ukraine&nbsp;that was then part of theSoviet Union.</p>
<p>
	The Cork-based charity has since broadened its mission to work with children, the homeless and the elderly in Russia, Ukraine and&nbsp;Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>
	Mr Putin was accompanied by Patriarch Kirill, the Primate of the Russian&nbsp;Christian Orthodox Church&nbsp;at the award ceremony in the Kremlin&rsquo;s gilded Saint George&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p>
	In a speech of thanks, Ms Corcoran told the Russian president she was accepting the award &ldquo;on behalf of the people of&nbsp;Ireland&nbsp;and other supporters who have helped us in our very long journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Ireland, like the countries where the Greater Chernobyl Cause works, had endured terrible tragedies in the past. Historic memories of the Great Famine of 1845 have fostered a tradition of charitable giving in Ireland, she said.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The award which you have bestowed on us today will bring our work forward for the very needy. As we say in Ireland &lsquo;go raibh mine maith agat,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>
	Supported by Oscar winning actor&nbsp;Jeremy Irons, among others, the Greater Chernobyl Cause works on projects such as rebuilding dilapidated orphanages and hospices, shipping humanitarian aid, organizing food programs and supplying medical equipment.</p>
<p>
	In Russia the charity runs a hospice in the remote village of Ivanskoye, 200 miles north east of&nbsp;Moscow&nbsp;and organizes a soup kitchen for the poor and homeless.</p>
<p>
	Charitable giving was frowned upon in Russia during the Soviet era when the communist authorities took responsibility for citizens&rsquo; needs. Many Russians have grown fabulously wealthy since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and a culture of philanthropy is beginning to take hold.</p>
<p>
	Ms Corcoran becomes the first Irish citizen to be decorated with the Russian Order of Friendship which is bestowed on individuals for their &ldquo;outstanding contributions to strengthening friendship and co-operation between nations.&rdquo;</p>
