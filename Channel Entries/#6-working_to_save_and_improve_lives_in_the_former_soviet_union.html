	Based in Cork, Ireland The Greater Chernobyl Cause began as a response to the world&#39;s worst nuclear disaster but has now widened its mission to concentrate on the human casualties of the break-up of the former Soviet Union. Supported by, among others, Actor Jeremy Irons, our work includes rebuilding squalid orphanages and hospices, shipping humanitarian aid, organizing food programmes and supplying vital medical equipment.
