	<span class="s1">The charity&rsquo;s head, Fiona Corcoran, was deeply moved when the world&rsquo;s worst nuclear disaster occurred at Chernobyl in Ukraine. An enthusiastic follower of the campaign for nuclear disarmament, she was shocked and horrified by the consequences of the explosion &ndash; so much so that she eventually gave up her job to work full time with the victims of the poisonous radioactive fallout. The subsequent collapse of The Soviet Union saw Fiona widen her efforts in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. These countries gained their independence but at an enormous cost in terms of financial and social support. The casualties of this poverty are abandoned children and desperate adults. While much of the world ignores their plight, the Greater Chernobyl cause has risen to the challenge to provide help and hope for the future.</span><br />
