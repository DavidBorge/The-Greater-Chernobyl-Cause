<!--THREE DECADES AFTER THE WORLD'S WORST NUCLEAR DISASTER-->


<p align="center">
	<strong><u>CHERNOBYL COMMEMORATION 30<sup>TH</sup></u></strong>&nbsp;<strong><u>ANNIVERSARY</u></strong></p>
<p>
	To coincide with the 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary of The Chernobyl Disaster,&nbsp;The Greater Chernobyl Cause will send&nbsp;a shipment filled with Humanitarian Aid. It will&nbsp; leave the Port of Cork bound for the our newly built hospice in Semipalatinsk Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>
	The aid includes vital hospital equipment, new clothes, therapy aids, household goods, etc. which will also go to the neglected hospitals, homeless shelters, care centres and impoverished villages in Kazakhstan.</p>




<p>
	As we commemorate the 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary of the Chernobyl Disaster, it is important to note that the people of Kazakhstan were also involved&nbsp;in the dreaded clean up at The Chernobyl Plant. In fact&nbsp;Leonid Petrovich Telyatnikov, who was born &nbsp;in&nbsp; 1951, in,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostanai_Province" target="_blank" title="Kostanai Province">Kostanai&nbsp;</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan" target="_blank" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;was the head of the fire department at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant" target="_blank" title="Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant</a>&nbsp;and led the team of firefighters to the fire at Reactor Number 4 which became the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" target="_blank" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>.</p>
<p>
	Despite the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation#Acute" target="_blank" title="Ionizing radiation">radiological dangers</a>, they had no&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_suit" target="_blank" title="NBC suit">radiation suits</a>, no&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respirator" target="_blank" title="Respirator">respirators</a>, and no working&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimeter" target="_blank" title="Dosimeter">dosimeters</a>. From the results of a blood test, it was estimated he received 4&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_%28unit%29" target="_blank" title="Gray (unit)">grays</a>&nbsp;of radiation.</p>
<p>
	Telyatnikov headed the firefighting effort at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_nuclear_power_plant" target="_blank" title="Chernobyl nuclear power plant">Chernobyl Reactor Unit 4</a>&nbsp;after the explosion on April 26, 1986. At that time Telyatnikov was the chief of military&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_prevention" target="_blank" title="Fire prevention">fire prevention</a>&nbsp;at the Chernobyl nuclear-power station. Telyatnikov and his colleagues, a number of those also from Kazakhstan (as these countries were all part of the USSR), ascended the badly damaged and heavily radiation-contaminated roof of Reactor Unit 4 more than once in order to prevent the fires from spreading and endangering Reactor Unit 3. In 1987 Telyatnikov was named a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union" target="_blank" title="Hero of the Soviet Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. Two of his assistants, Vladimir Pravik and Viktor Kibenok, were given the award posthumously, as they died from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_sickness" target="_blank" title="Acute radiation sickness">acute radiation sickness</a>&nbsp;soon after the disaster.</p>
<p>
	Telyatnikov continued his service in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_%28Russia%29" target="_blank" title="Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)">Ministry of the Interior</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR" target="_blank" title="USSR">USSR</a>&nbsp;and,&nbsp;following the collapse of the Soviet Union, in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine" target="_blank" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>
	In 1998, Telyatnikov headed the volunteer fire department of Kiev, and designed the &quot;Junior Firefighter&quot; program.&nbsp; He died of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer" target="_blank" title="Cancer">cancer</a>&nbsp;at the age of 53. On April 26, 2006, the twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, a monument was dedicated to him at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykove_cemetery" target="_blank" title="Baykove cemetery">Baykove cemetery</a>&nbsp;in Kiev where he is buried.</p>
<p>
	This 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary marks the starting point &ndash; not the limit &ndash; of the Chernobyl catastrophe which continues to unfold even today. Chernobyl is not in the past. Its repercussions are still being felt by some five million people living in areas of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia who were contaminated as a result of the accident. They have to cope with the ongoing political, social, environmental and health consequences of the disaster.</p>
<p>
	We must ensure that no more Chernobyl&#39;s ever take place again. The only way we can do this is to ensure that nuclear power has no future, whilst investing in renewable alternatives. Those who speak about the benefits of nuclear power should look deeply into the eyes and souls of the innocent victims, generations of alienated and forgotten people.&nbsp; Whatever the obstacles we encounter along the way, we are certain of one thing &hellip; the plight of its abandoned people cannot be forgotten.</p>
