<!-- Title: History - The Chernobyl Disaster -->

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">The&nbsp;<strong>Chernobyl disaster</strong>&nbsp;began during a systems test on&nbsp;<strong>26 April 1986</strong>&nbsp;at reactor number four of the Chernobyl plant, which is near&nbsp;Pripyat&nbsp;and in proximity to the administrative border with&nbsp;Belarus&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Dnieper&nbsp;River. There was a sudden and unexpected power surge, and when an emergency shutdown was attempted, a much larger spike in power output occurred, which led&nbsp;to a&nbsp;reactor vessel&nbsp;rupture and a series of steam explosions. These events exposed the&nbsp;graphite&nbsp;moderator&nbsp;of the reactor to air, causing it to ignite.&nbsp;The resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive&nbsp;fallout&nbsp;into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area, including Pripyat. The plumes drifted over large parts of the western&nbsp;Soviet Union&nbsp;and Europe. According to official post-Soviet data,&nbsp;about 60% of the fallout landed in Belarus.</span></span></span></p>

	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">36 hours after the accident Soviet officials enacted a 10-kilometre&nbsp;exclusion zone&nbsp;which resulted in the rapid evacuation of&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">49,000 people</strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;and their animals, primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor, the town of Pripyat.&nbsp;Although not communicated at the time, an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy&nbsp;nuclear fallout&nbsp;&quot;hotspots&quot; deposited on it, while up to around that point, the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction, permitting&nbsp;shelter in place&nbsp;to be the best safety measure to take for the town, before the winds began to change direction.</span></span></p>

	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">As the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated, the&nbsp;evacuation zone&nbsp;was increased from&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">10 to 30&nbsp;km</strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;about one week after the accident, resulting in a further&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">68,000&nbsp;people</strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;evacuated, including from the&nbsp;town of Chernobyl&nbsp;itself.&nbsp;The surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">135,000 &quot;long-term evacuees&quot;</strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;in total, accepting to be moved.</span></span></p>

	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">350,000 over the decades, 1986 to 2000</strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">, from the most severely &quot;contaminated&quot; areas,&nbsp;is regarded as largely political in nature, with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government, which was most common&nbsp;around 1990.</span></span></p>

	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The accident raised the already heightened concerns about&nbsp;fission reactors&nbsp;worldwide, and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design, hundreds of disparate&nbsp;electric-power reactor&nbsp;proposals, including those under construction at Chernobyl,&nbsp;reactor No.5 and 6, were eventually cancelled. With the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new&nbsp;nuclear reactor safety system&nbsp;standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly hostile/anxious public opinion. There was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new &quot;startups&quot;, after 1986.</span></span></p>
