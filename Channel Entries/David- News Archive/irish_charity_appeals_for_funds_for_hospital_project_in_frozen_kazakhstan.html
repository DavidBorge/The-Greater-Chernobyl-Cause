	[Already, work has begun to turn the joint Red Cross/Red Crescent building in the industrial city of Semipalatinsk into a hospice worthy of the name where patients can find warmth and dignity alongside the palliative care they so desperately need.]
</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	[Charity head, Fiona Corcoran, was so shocked by the conditions she encountered on a recent visit there that with characteristic energy and determination, she decided to act immediately. Generous donations combined with the charity’s hard work have already resulted in some major improvements.]

	[Better hygiene means that the stench of urine has been removed and the pitiful daily food allowance of just 4 cents per patient has been increased to 1 Euro, allowing fresh meat and vegetables to be introduced to a menu that once produced little more than a watery porridge gruel.]

</p>

<p class="flow-text text-justify">
	[To compound matters, Semipalatinsk is in an area that has long been contaminated with radioactive fallout from the Soviet Union’s 40 year nuclear testing programme.
