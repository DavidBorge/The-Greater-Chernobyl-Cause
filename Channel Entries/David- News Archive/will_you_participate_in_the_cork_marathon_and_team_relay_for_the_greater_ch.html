	[Teams can be mixed or all male/all female
Each Team appoints one member as a Captain, who will be the point of contact for the race organisers.
Only one entry form per team is required - the Team Captain must fill this out. The form is the same as for the individual marathon, but additional details must be filled in for the Relay.  
As with the individual marathon, all team members must be 18 years of age or older on 5th June 2011.]
