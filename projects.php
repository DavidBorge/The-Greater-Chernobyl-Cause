			Kazakhstan was part of the old Soviet Union. It lies in Central Asia, four thousand miles from Ireland and the country is as large as the whole of Western Europe. It shares a border with Russia in the North, stretches to the Caspian Sea in the west and to China and Mongolia in the east.

			<amp-vimeo data-videoid="17743031" width="640" height="480" layout="responsive" class="video-4x3"></amp-vimeo>
			<p class="flow-text text-justify">In the autumn of 2008 Fiona Corcoran from the Irish charity The Greater Chernobyl Cause first visited this hospice for the elderly in Semipalatinsk, an industrial city in north east Kazakhstan.</p>
			<p class="flow-text text-justify">She was so shocked by the desperate plight of the residents and the squalor inside the dilapidated building that she decided to act immediately.</p>
			<p class="flow-text text-justify">Now, two years on and thanks to generous donations and the charity's hard work, there have been some major improvements to diet, medical care and hygiene.</p>
			<p class="flow-text text-justify">But best of all is the charity's plan to build an entirely new hospice in the grounds of the city's general hospital.</p>
			<p class="flow-text text-justify">This hospital though has problems of its own. One of the most urgent is the repair of the CAT scanner, out of action since June 2010. It would normally be used by 1500 cases a year, 500 of them very serious.</p>
			<p class="last-paragraph flow-text text-justify">The Greater Chernobyl Cause wants to help get this scanner working again by supplying vital components.</p>

Sadly, under funded and ill equipped orphanages are still all too common. 17,000 orphans are confined to grim institutions. The majority have been abandoned by parents, unable - either through poverty or neglect - to look after their needs.</p>

			<p class="last-paragraph flow-text text-justify">Sadly, some of the children are victims of a Soviet legacy that is continuing to poison the land and its people. For it was in East Kazakhstan that one third of the world’s nuclear tests took place in total secrecy. There were as many as 500 explosions in 40 years and some mothers exposed to radiation fallout wonder about the long term effects for their families. Take a look at the situation in one village close to the test site.</p>

			<p class="flow-text text-justify">The Director of the charity, Fiona Corcoran, was appalled at the thought that the Soviets had used their own people as ‘human guinea pigs’. Walking in the area of the test site, she found that radiation levels were still 400 times above normal.</p>
			<p class="last-paragraph flow-text text-justify">This tragedy has compelled her into trying to help Kazak children of all backgrounds and disabilities condemned to life in filthy and dilapidated state institutions where staff are given few resources and rely heavily on outside help from wherever it comes. Take a look at life inside an orphanage transformed by the only Irish charity working in this most difficult country.</p>

			Ukraine was once part of the mighty Soviet Union and along with Hungary the bread basket of Eastern Europe. Since the collapse of hard line communism, this vast country has had many other problems to contend with, not least grinding poverty and high unemployment. In such harsh conditions, children often end up paying the price.

Here, in the depths of winter and with the temperature a cruel 20 degrees below freezing, she visited the community’s dilapidated hospice and listened to disturbing stories from some of Russia’s poorest people. Maybe you’d like to watch and listen too.</p>
